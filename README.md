# Blackjack Game Project üÉè

## Project Description
This Python-based Blackjack game simulates the classic card game with dynamic gameplay and user interaction. Players compete against the computer, with rules and scoring inspired by the real-world game of Blackjack.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Card Dealing**: Randomly draws cards for both the player and the computer.
- **Score Calculation**: Implements special rules for Aces (11 or 1) and detects Blackjack (21).
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (pass).
- **Game Outcome Feedback**: Clear results, including win, loss, or draw, with fun messages.
- **Replay Option**: Players can start a new game after each round.
